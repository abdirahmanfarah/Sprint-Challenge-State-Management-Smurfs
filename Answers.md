1. What problem does the context API help solve?

It helps us simplify state management.

1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

Store is where all the state of an application is stored in a redux-react app. Reducers help us write pure functions to manage stae changes, and actions are useeffects that we use to illicit a change in an app, like sending data, clicking a button, etc. 

1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?
1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

As insanely hard as it, redux. The idea of it is quite interesting, but I wish I could understand it better.
